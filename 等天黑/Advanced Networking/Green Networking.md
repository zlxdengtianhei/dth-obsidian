hardware 
routing protocols
network topology
other protocols

node level:
power adjustable components
Energy-efficient silicon
optical components
modular design
turn off unused modules

link level:

ALR-Adaptive Link Rate
deep idle
idle/sleep and buffer packets
idle/sleep and fully awake

EEE(Energy Efficient Ethernet):
default wake-up time similar to delay of a maximum packet

Network level
green OSPF
EAR:
use subnet of SPTs(shortest Path First)
to select paths
use exporters as reference
determine modified path tree

collect link load for traffic matrix
collect network topology
calculate 
advertise result
Routers turn on/off links
